## 1.1 Computer Mouse
Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure
that it is of the highest quality.

The types of tests we have identified to ensure us a mouse of the highest 
quality is listed below.

### Functional Testing
- Unit Testing
- Boundary Value Testing
- Branch Testing
- Component Testing
- Gorilla Testing
- Negative Testing

### Non-functional Testing
- Usability Testing
- Alpha Testing
- Beta Testing
- Comparison Testing
- Compatibility Testing
- Install/Uninstall Testing
- Load Testing
- Monkey Testing
- Mutation Testing
- Performance Testing
- Recovery Testing
- Stress test

## 1.2 Catastrophic Failure
Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what
happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?

### Story 
On June 4, 1996, an Ariane 5 rocket launched by the ESA (European Space Agency) 
exploded just forty seconds after its launch from Kourou in the French Guiana. 
The rocket was on its inaugural voyage, after a decade of development costing 
$8 billion and the result of this bug was the loss of $370 million.
The reason behind its failure was an integer Overflow, which is a widespread 
bug in computer programming. In this case, an attempt was made to set a 64-bit 
number in 16-bit space.
